# DEVMART GUARDIAN RULES v2.0

## NON-NEGOTIABLE EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**(Supreme Governance Authority)**

---

## 0. SUPREME AUTHORITY CLAUSE

This document is the highest governance authority for this repository.

If any conflict exists between this document and:

- Phase documents
- Tasks.md
- Implementation Blueprints
- Any other file

**This document overrides. No exception.**

---

## 1. TEMPLATE PARITY — 1:1 LOCK (HARD RULE)

- Darkone Admin must remain 1:1.
- Gorent Frontend must remain 1:1.
- No structural deviation.
- No UI improvisation.
- No layout refactoring.
- No component redesign.

**Any deviation = Governance Violation.**

---

## 2. ABSOLUTE DESIGN PROHIBITION

Strictly forbidden:

- Custom icons
- Bootstrap additions
- New UI libraries
- Design "improvements"
- Personal UX decisions
- Layout "optimizations"

**Lovable is an executor — not a designer.**

---

## 3. DARKONE ASSET MAP MANDATORY

For Admin:

- DARKONE_ASSET_MAP must be referenced before module creation.
- No new structure outside mapped structure.
- No renamed assets.
- No class restructuring.

---

## 4. EXECUTION ORDER LOCK (HARD GATE)

Mandatory sequence:

1. Phase 0 — Repo Stabilization
2. Phase 10 — Frontend 1:1 Static Parity
3. Parity Verification Gate — Formal Approval Required
4. Database Waves
5. Admin Wiring
6. Public Dynamic Integration

Until parity is approved:

- ❌ NO SQL
- ❌ NO migrations
- ❌ NO RLS
- ❌ NO storage buckets
- ❌ NO Supabase integration
- ❌ NO dynamic queries

---

## 5. RESTORE POINT PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

Before ANY of the following:

- Folder restructuring
- Dependency installation
- Routing modification
- Styling changes
- Schema work
- RLS work
- Refactoring

A Restore Point must be created.

**Naming Convention:** `RP-PhaseX-StepY-Timestamp`

Each Restore Point must be:

- Confirmed in task report
- Logged in appropriate phase log
- Referenced before implementation begins

**No Restore Point → No Execution.**

---

## 6. DUPLICATION CONTROL RULE

Before implementing any feature:

- Search for existing code
- Confirm no duplicate logic
- Confirm no redundant imports
- Confirm no duplicate routes

**Duplicate code is forbidden.**

---

## 7. SINGLE BUILD + STRICT ISOLATION

Deployment target:

- Single Vite build
- Public at `/`
- Admin at `/admin`
- Shared repo, isolated styling

CSS/SCSS isolation mandatory:

- No leakage between admin and public
- No shared styling assumptions
- No global override contamination

---

## 8. EXTERNAL SUPABASE ONLY

- No Lovable Cloud DB
- Supabase external only
- No hidden DB coupling
- No local mock DB after integration phase

---

## 9. BUILD INTEGRITY RULE (HARD STOP)

If:

- Build fails
- Runtime errors appear
- Console errors increase
- Routing breaks
- Layout shifts unexpectedly

**STOP immediately. Do not continue. Report issue. Await instruction.**

---

## 10. REPORTING MANDATORY (NO EXCEPTIONS)

After every task, Lovable must report:

- What was implemented
- What was partially implemented
- What was skipped
- What errors occurred
- Restore Point reference
- Scope confirmation

**Missing report = governance breach.**

---

## 11. VIOLATION PROTOCOL

If a rule is violated:

1. STOP immediately
2. Report deviation
3. Revert to last Restore Point
4. Await further instructions

**No silent fixes. No hidden adjustments.**

---

## 12. MANDATORY PRE-TASK COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST

Before starting ANY task, Lovable must confirm:

- [ ] Guardian Rules referenced
- [ ] Execution order validated
- [ ] Restore Point created
- [ ] No duplicate code detected
- [ ] No custom UI libraries added
- [ ] Darkone 1:1 confirmed (if admin)
- [ ] Gorent 1:1 confirmed (if frontend)
- [ ] Build currently stable
- [ ] Out-of-scope untouched

**No checklist confirmation → No execution.**

---

## 13. SCOPE CREEP ZERO TOLERANCE

No:

- Improvements outside instruction
- Refactoring without permission
- Enhancements beyond spec
- "Best practice" substitutions
- Autonomous optimizations

**If uncertain → ASK.**

---

## 14. FINAL RULE — STOP / ASK / WAIT

If any uncertainty exists:

**STOP. ASK. WAIT.**

Never assume.

---

## GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM

No task may begin without:

1. Explicit reference to this Guardian Rules document
2. Restore Point creation and confirmation
3. Pre-task compliance checklist completed

**Deviation definitions:**

- Any deviation from 1:1 template parity = Governance Violation
- Any autonomous design decision = Governance Violation
- Any undocumented change = Governance Violation

---

## GOVERNANCE ENFORCEMENT PATCH

### Execution Order Hard Lock

The following sequence is mandatory and cannot be overridden:

1. Phase 0 — Repo Stabilization
2. Phase 10 — Frontend 1:1 Static Parity (no DB)
3. Parity Verification Gate — Formal Approval Required
4. Database Implementation Waves 1–5
5. Admin Wiring
6. Public Dynamic Reads

### Restore Point Requirement

Before ANY structural, schema, routing, styling, or dependency change → a Restore Point must be created and confirmed.

### Conflict Resolution

If conflict exists between this document and any other file → **this document overrides.**

**END OF DOCUMENT**
